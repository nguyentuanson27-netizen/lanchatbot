# Durable Contract — Runtime Behavior Control Plane

Behavior modes are versioned, database-backed, page-scoped, immutable, auditable, and dynamically resolved. Environment variables are startup fail-safe defaults only.

Required properties:

- immutable behavior-mode versions with canonical content hash;
- CAS-protected current pointer/revision;
- append-only activation audit with actor, prior/new revision, reason, and timestamp;
- worker readback of version, hash, resolved value, and source;
- bounded cache propagation of at most five seconds;
- bounded last-known-good use of at most five minutes;
- explicit safe fallback after last-known-good expiry;
- least-privilege database access;
- no secret or PII in payload, audit, or readback;
- normal page/episode pinning where mixed authority would be unsafe;
- audited emergency override that requires no redeploy.

Current durable mode dimensions:

```text
confirmation: V2_ACTIVE; emergency CLARIFY_ONLY
sales authority: LEGACY; future SHADOW -> COMMERCE
state read: LEGACY; future SHADOW -> V2
```

Incident policies may extend the versioned payload, but they must not become env-only flags or independent untracked authorities. Security fallback must remain fail-closed. Claim verification must never have a mode that restores an unverified business claim.
